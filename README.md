# time-keeper
## Small project for tracting work time.
---
### Description
This project is small in scope and meant to aid hourly employees track their time worked. The program displays a GUI that has a clock as well as buttons to "clock in" and "clock out". In addition, the entries can be exported to a csv file for use in spreadsheet software. The GUI is ugly right now but gets the job done.

Currently there is only a binary released for Windows, however all code is written in Python and should be easy to run on other OSes
